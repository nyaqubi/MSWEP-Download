# MSWEP-Download
#With this script, you can download specific MSWEP - 3 Hourly Rainfall files using a list generated in Windows PowerShell, once the Google Drive is successfully #linked with Rclone.
#Ensure you create a script (yourlist.ps1) file using Notepad. For other dates, use an Excel file and formulas to generate the file names and replace them in the script.  
#To create a text file of the list, you can use R to concatenate the lists vertically with commas. Then, copy and replace the list in the (yourlist.ps1) script.
